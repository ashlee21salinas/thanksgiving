        <p> The turkey is a classic Thanksgiving meal. Here in the United States the
            turkey is the symbol for Thanksgiving. It is made over 50 ways and all
            taste amazing. Turkey can be made with so many different things like stuffing,
            mashed potatoes, salad almost anything. It is basically the center of the food.
            Here is my favorite way to make it in the oven or even in the air-fryer.
